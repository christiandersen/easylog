# easylog
A .net standard 2.0 library which logs in files and places them in c:\temp. The front of the filename becomes the name of the calling assembly and the extension is .log. Created because of the need of a simple file logging, while putting products into production, reducing doubts about correct configuration and whether other systems are running properly and are configured correctly.

Can be installed by calling:
Install-Package ChristiAndersen.Easylog
